# ReBorn Framework

  ReBorn Framework is a way of coding a React app with a specific Design Pattern using the best parts of React and the wisdom of other technology like Game Development.  If you are familiar React and/or with MVC, this will make sense right away.  I took all the parts of each language or platform I've worked on and sythesized it into a singular Framework that has 4 dependencies, no external CSS files, no Redux, and performs amazingly out of the box.  


## Usage with boilerplate Node back end
Install [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) globally

```
npm i nodemon -g
```

Install server and client dependencies

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

To start the server and client at the same time (from the root of the project)

```
npm run dev
```
