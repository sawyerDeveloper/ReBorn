# ReBorn Framework

  ReBorn Framework is a way of coding a React app with a specific Design Pattern using the best parts of React and the wisdom of other technology like Game Development.  If you are familiar React and/or with MVC, this will make sense right away.  I took all the parts of each language or platform I've worked on and sythesized it into a singular Framework that has 4 dependencies, no external CSS files, no Redux, and performs amazingly out of the box.  
  This is the culmination of years of study, pain, trial and error, and those few and far between moments of pure joy when you know you broke through to the other side.  To those who know what I mean...I salute you.
  ReBorn is Open Source and always will be.  Thanks world!
