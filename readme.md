# ReBorn Framework

ReBorn Framework is a way of coding a React app with a specific approach and Design Pattern so that not only are you using the best parts of React but also the wisdom of other technology mixed in.  For instance if you are familiar with MVC - this will make sense right away.  If you know React, again, this will just make sense.  I took all the parts of each language or platform I've worked on and sythesized it into a singular Framework that has 4 dependencies, no external CSS files, no Redux, and performs amazingly out of the box.  
This is the culmination of years of study, pain, trial and error, and those few and far between moments of pure joy when you know you broke through to the other side.  To those who know what I mean...I salute you.
This is Open Source and always will be.  Thanks world!
